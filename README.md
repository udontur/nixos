## ‚ùå Not everything is reproducable!
### 1. Zen browser
Please copy your Zen browser profiles in the `.zen`.

> [!WARNING]
> A Zen profile as it contains everything, including sensetive data. **DO NOT** share it publicly. 

### 2. p10k configuration
p10k is not declared by home manager because of it's large file size. New p10k setup will be prompt by the p10k configurator.
    
### 3. Wakatime API
The API is obviously not reproducable. Make sure to include your own `~/.wakatime.cfg` to make wakatime work.
