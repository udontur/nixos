## ‚ùå Non-Reproducable applications
### 1. Zen browser configuration 
Firefox Sync is enabled, so you can sync:
  - Extensions
  - Non-sensitive extension settings
  - Zen settings
  - Workspaces and containers

You cannot sync:
  - Any sensitive data
  - about:config
  - Tabs, Essentials, and pinned tabs
  - Any other stuff that is not mentioned

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT** copy your Zen profile as it contains everything, including sensetive data.

### 2. p10k configuration
p10k is not declared by home manager because of it's large file size. New p10k setup will be prompt by the p10k configurator.

### 3. Wakatime API
The API is obviously not reproducable. Make sure to include your own `~/.wakatime.cfg` to make wakatime work.
